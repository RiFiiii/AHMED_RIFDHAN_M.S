	 *  Design Patterns : By Definition Design Patterns are reusable Solutions to Commonly Occuring Problems
	 *  ( in the Context of Software design) Design patterns are Started as the best practices 
	 *  that were applied again and again to similar problems encountered in different contexts.
	 *  they become popular after they were collected in a formalized form in the gang of four book in 1994.
	 *  orginally published with c++ and smallTalk code samples Design Patterns are Very Popular in java and c#
	 *  can be applied in all object oriented languages in functional languages like scala,certain patterns are not neccesary anymore.

	 * Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and provide a global access point to the object

	 * Objective 
	 * 
	 *  TO Ensure that the object creation of particular class is restricted to only one object
	 *  
	 *   Advantages 
	 *   
	 *   Multiple Object of Certain class Could be a problem , so we Dont allow Them to create Multiple Objects.
	 *   
	 *   Factory : 
	 *   
	 *   Simplified Versions of Factory Method
	 *   create objects Without Exposing the instantiated logic to the client and refers to the newly Created Object through a common interface.
